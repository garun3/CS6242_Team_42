DESCRIPTION

This package contains the files needed to run a choropleth visualization of happiness score for countries from 2012-2021. 

The World Happiness Report is a publication that is 
released every year. It uses reponses from Gallup World Polls as well as other sources to provide a compilation of data on happiness around the world.
